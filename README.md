# Election Data Project: Project Overview

## Project Introduction
* This Data Project is an EDA project looking at data from the 2012 election, drilling into 2 main datasets: Polls and Donors
* For the Poll Dataset, I analyzed and visualized the demographic of the people being polled and how their sentiments change over time 
* For the Donors Dataset, I also analyzed and visualized the patterns and demographic of donors and their donations

## Code and Resource used
**Python Version:** 3.9
* Packages: panda, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 

## EDA Highlights
Below are some of the highlights of my finding for both the Polls and Donors dataset

* Insight: While the first 2 debates spark some interesting change in polling, the last debate sees voter already set in stone for their decision

* Insight: There's a large amount of unregistered voters, especially amongst the unaffiliated. The party with the most registered voters is Democrats

* Insight: The 2 final contender for the Presidential tickets were received the highest amount of donation. Barack, the winner, overwhelms his opponent with nearly 1.4 million USD raised

* Insight: It's really interesting how retirees donates overwhelmingly more than other occupations (even for both parties).
